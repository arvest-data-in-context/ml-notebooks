## Projects

A number of different research projects drove the writing of these scripts. Some scripts form these projects are included in this repo.

- [Arvest](https://arvest.gitpages.huma-num.fr/): these scripts were written in the context of the development of Arvest, an environment for manipulation networks of digital traces.
- [Polzevet](): a case study based on the Plozevet corpus. Find the scripts [here](/colab/projects/plozevet/).
- [fablab](): a small case study looking to extract and analyse data from the fablab network websites. Find the scripts [here](/colab/projects/fablab/).
