A IIIF Manifest is a light weight json file that allows us to point to media that is hosted online (or several medias in one Manifest), and also define things like metadata and annotations. It follows a standardized structure that is defined by the [IIIF Presentation API](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/)."

    "In order to work, IIIF needs the URL of an accesible media file on the internet. There are plenty of services that let you store files and render them accessible, some of them are free, some you will have to pay for. Here are a few:\n",
    "- [Internet archive](https://archive.org/): you can store any type of file on internet archive.\n",
    "- [Github](https://github.com/): if you have a github account, you can upload small files to a repo and access them with a direct url.\n",
    "- [Nakala](https://www.nakala.fr/): run by Huma-Num, Nakala is a service that allows you to store data for digital humanities projects.\n",
    "- [File Browser](https://filebrowser.org/): file browser is an open source file hosting system you can set up on your own server.\n",
    "- [Arvest](https://arvest.app): Arvest is a digital humanities tool specifically designed for IIIF which also lets you store media.\n",
    "- [Imgur](https://imgur.com/): a free image storing service.\n",
    "- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/): you will need to change the prefix of the link link from `www.dropbox.com` to `dl.dropboxusercontent.com`.\n",
    "- [Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/s3/): a paid service provided by amazon.\n",
    "- [pCloud](https://www.pcloud.com/fr/eu): a paid storage solution.\n",
    "- [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Accueil): a free storage solution provided by the Wikimedia Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will know that a file is directly available if you go to the link in an internet browser and nothing but the media file's contents appears. For the purposes of this module, we shall use some content that we know is available at the following adresses (follow the links to see them), however you can always replace these file names with your own.
