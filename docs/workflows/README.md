Here, we proose a number of workflow tutorials which will take you through a number of common digital humanities workflows. These have been designed so that you can store the media you wish to process and view the results in [Arvest](https://arvest.app/en). These are start to end workflows, for more details about the various modules, please see the [modules](/docs/modules/README.md) section.

**⚠️ Please note that these notebooks are pedagogical in tone and configuration. If you are looking for notebooks where all you need to do is drop your media and press play, please visit the [Arvest API Tools](https://github.com/arvest-data-in-context/arvest-api-tools) repo which is designed as a collection of functional tools that follow many of these same workflows.**
