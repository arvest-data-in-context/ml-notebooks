[Arvest](https://arvest.app/en) is a free to use web app that allows you to store your corpora online and view and share the results of machine learning processes. These notbooks will take you through the Arvest platform and its API, and show you how to manage your media and create IIIF Manifests and porjects to share the results of your work with the world.

**Please note that these notebooks are pedagogical in tone and configuration. If you are looking for notebooks where all you need to do is drop your media and press play, please visit the [Arvest API Tools](https://github.com/arvest-data-in-context/arvest-api-tools) repo which is designed as a collection of functional tools that follow many of these same workflows.**
